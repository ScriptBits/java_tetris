# java_tetris

The goal here is to convert this Tetris game into an HTML5 online game.  Maybe someone will help out with task.  Maybe one of my students will be advanced enough to take on this challenge.

Again, converting to the HTML gives more students to access the coding tools and hardware since the online sandboxes are very JavaScript freindly.  Too many students don't have access to their own laptops/desktops.
